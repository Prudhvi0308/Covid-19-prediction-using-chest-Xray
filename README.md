Project Overview
This project aims to build an efficient deep learning model to automatically detect COVID-19 infections using chest X-ray images. Early detection of COVID-19 is crucial for timely treatment, and X-ray imaging offers a fast, low-cost diagnostic tool. This project leverages image processing and neural networks to classify chest X-rays as COVID-19 positive or negative.

Key Features
Deep Learning Model: Utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification.
Dataset: Publicly available X-ray images dataset of both COVID-19 positive and healthy patients.
Accuracy and Metrics: Includes evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to assess the model's performance.
Data Augmentation: Employs various augmentation techniques like rotation, flipping, and zoom to improve the modelâ€™s generalization.
User-Friendly Interface: Offers an easy-to-use interface for uploading and predicting results on new X-ray images.
Technology Stack
Programming Language: Python
Deep Learning Framework: TensorFlow/Keras
Data Preprocessing: OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Model Evaluation: Scikit-learn
